# Paellu Bio

- 👋 Hi, [I’m Paellu](elwinplum@gmail.com).
- 💼 Moonlighting Coder

💬 What started as a simple hobby to de-stress turned into one of my greatest passion.
Creating, learning, experimenting and improving became my motivations to learn to code.

```
"The only way to do great work is to love what you do."
                                           - Steve Jobs
```

Sadly on my self taught creative journey many mishaps (like theft, relocating, house fires and natural disasters) have caused me to lose most of my work.

```
“If you really want to do something, you'll find a way. 
 If you don't, you'll find an excuse.”
                                             - Jim Rohn
```
So  that was on me for not using cloud services and will take this time to encourage you to do so if you have not already.

## 🎨 Plans

To use what i've learnt to encourage others the way the open source community did for me.

```

“If you want to learn something, read about it. 
 If you want to understand something, write about it. 
 If you want to master something, teach it.”
